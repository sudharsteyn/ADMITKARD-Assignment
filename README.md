# Text analyser and Search

In this project if we upload a text file with .txt format and file upto 5MB that will uploaded to the backend server there that file will analyze the given text file and send json response as Top 5 mostly occurred words, Top 5 mostly co-occurred words ( adjacent words in pairs ), and Frequency of each word.

Also we can search words to see that how many times that will appears on the file
